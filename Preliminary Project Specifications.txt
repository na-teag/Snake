The requirements for the project task are as follows:

Design an entity-component-system (ECS) engine for video games in JavaScript and implement a simple example of a game using the constructed engine.
The project must adhere to the functional programming paradigm.

The ECS system must include the following systems:
	- User interface system (keyboard and/or mouse and/or text input)
	- Rendering system


The project should also include at least three (4) systems that the student defines for the game they are implementing.
For example:
	- Physics system for a bird
	- System for flipping cards in a memory game
	- AI opponent system

When creating the project, students must demonstrate the application of basic principles covered in the functional programming course:
	- Application of function composition
	- Respect for immutability
	- Use of higher-order functions
	- Application of map, filter, reduce functions
	- Use of a Monad for encapsulation of side-effects 

Points are awarded based on the defense, implementing the required changes in the proposed project solution, and answers to theoretical questions.
